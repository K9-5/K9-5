# 🚀 Welcome to My Profile

Student Developer • Aspiring Full-Stack Engineer • Cybersecurity Enthusiast

I'm David Okechukwu Kennedy-Dike, a curious and committed developer passionate about building solutions that are functional, efficient, and user-friendly.
My journey cuts across both front-end and back-end development, and I’m steadily sharpening my skills in:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Node.js & Back-end fundamentals

C, C++, Java & PHP

I’m currently leveling up as a full-stack web developer, while also developing a strong foundation in cybersecurity—learning how to secure applications, understand vulnerabilities, and think like both a developer and a defender.

I learn best by doing: mini-projects, open-source contributions, debugging with peers, and building tools that solve real problems.
